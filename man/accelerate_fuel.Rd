\usage{
accelerate_fuel(
  df,
  ind_ids = billion_ind_codes("hpop"),
  iso3 = "iso3",
  ind = "ind",
  scenario = "scenario",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame in long format, where 1 row corresponds to a specific
country, year, and indicator.}

\item{ind_ids}{Named vector of indicator codes for input indicators to the Billion.
Although separate indicator codes can be used than the standard, they must
be supplied as a named vector where the names correspond to the output of
\code{billion_ind_codes()}.}

\item{iso3}{Column name of column with country ISO3 codes.}

\item{ind}{Column name of column with indicator names.}

\item{scenario}{Column name of column with scenario identifiers. Useful for
calculating contributions on data in long format rather than wide format.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be passed to scenario function}
}
\value{
data frame with acceleration scenario binded to \code{df}. \code{scenario} is
set to \code{acceleration}
}
\description{
Accelerate devontrack by keeping business as usual for high income countries
(HIC) (according to the World Bank), and by aiming at the best rate of change

Low-income countries (LIC), High-income countries(HIC), and for unclassified
countries.

Runs:
\itemize{
\item \code{scenario_bau(df, small_is_best = FALSE,...)} for HIC,
\item \code{scenario_best_in_region(df, target_year = 2018, baseline_year = 2013, small_is_best = FALSE,...)} for other income groups.
