\arguments{
\item{billion}{Billions data to load, one of "hep" (default), "hpop", "uhc", or "all".}

\item{mart_table}{Name of xMart4 table in the GPW13 mart to load data from.
\itemize{
\item \code{full_data}: Full Billions data with transformed values, contributions,
and all calculations available. (default)
\item \code{raw_data}: Raw input Billions data, that has yet to be transformed or
calculated upon, but has been fully projected. Includes full history.
\item \code{projected_data}: A copy of \code{raw_data} with only the latest data.
\item \code{proj_data}: Raw input Billions data that has been projected by the
technical programme(s).
\item \code{unproj_data}: Raw input Billions that has has not been projected by the

\item{date_filter}{One of \code{NULL}, "latest", or a single date string. The date
string needs to be in ISO6801 format, such as "1989-4-4" or "1988-06-21".
If a date is provided, will only take values loaded on or prior to that
date into the xMart4 database.}

\item{na_rm}{Logical value, specifying whether to filter the data to only rows
where \code{value} is not missing. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{format}{Specification of the output format to be returned by the xMart API.
Defaults to \code{"csv"} for faster download and processing times.
Passed to \code{\link[xmart4:xmart4_table]{xmart4::xmart4_table()}}. See the

for details on all three options ("csv", "streaming", and "none").}

\description{
\code{load_billion_data_legacy()} is the legacy version of \code{\link[=load_billion_data]{load_billion_data()}}.
It provides access to the raw inputs to the Billions stored within the World
Health Organization's xMart4 database. By default, it filters
the loaded data to take the most recently uploaded data for each indicator,
country, and year. The user can also specify to take the latest data before a
certain time period, or to extract all data from the database.
