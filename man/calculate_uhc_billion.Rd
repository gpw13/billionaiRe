\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame in long format, where 1 row corresponds to a specific
country, year, and indicator.}

\item{year}{Column name of column with years.}

\item{iso3}{Column name of column with country ISO3 codes.}

\item{ind}{Column name of column with indicator names.}

\item{transform_value}{Column name of column(s) with transformed indicator values,
used to calculate contributions.}

\item{value}{Column name of column with indicator values.}

\item{scenario}{Column name of column with scenario identifiers. Useful for
calculating contributions on data in long format rather than wide format.}

\item{type_col}{Column name of column to store type.}

\item{source_col}{Column name of column to store source information.}

\item{source}{Source to provide for calculated average service coverage and
single measure.}

\item{projected_year}{Year that calculated data will be regarded as projected.
Years prior reported as estimated.}

\item{ind_ids}{Named vector of indicator codes for input indicators to the Billion.
Although separate indicator codes can be used than the standard, they must
be supplied as a named vector where the names correspond to the output of
\code{billion_ind_codes()}.}
}
\value{
Data frame in long format.
}
\description{
\code{calculate_uhc_billion()} calculates country-level UHC Billion based on
indicator level data. Calculates it for each country-year combination in the provided data.
In order to calculate average service coverage, and thus the overall Billion,
all UHC indicators must be present for a given year. The only exception is
insecticide treated nets, which need not be present.
