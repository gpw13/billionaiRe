\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame in long format, where 1 row corresponds to a specific
country, year, and indicator.}

\item{ind}{Column name of column with indicator names.}

\item{ind_ids}{Named vector of indicator codes for input indicators to the Billion.
Although separate indicator codes can be used than the standard, they must
be supplied as a named vector where the names correspond to the output of
\code{billion_ind_codes()}.}

\item{scenario}{Column name of column with scenario identifiers. Useful for
calculating contributions on data in long format rather than wide format.}

\item{iso3}{Column name of column with country ISO3 codes.}

\item{year}{Column name of column with years.}

\item{value}{Column name of column with indicator values.}

\item{start_year}{Base year for contribution calculation, defaults to 2018.}

\item{end_year}{End year(s) for contribution calculation, defaults to 2019 to 2025.}

\item{type_col}{Column name of column to store type.}

\item{years_best_performance}{vector of years with the years in which the
best performance should be found.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to to pass to \code{recycle_data}}
}
\value{
data frame with acceleration scenario binded to \code{df}. \code{scenario} is
set to \code{acceleration}
}
\description{
Accelerate yellow_fever_campaign by adding planned yellow fever campaigns to the
provided values in \code{df}. When a value is reported for a year and country, then this
value is kept, even after 2018. Some planned values are provided only for the
denominator. For some planned campaigns only the denominator is provided. When
this is the case, the numerator is calculated by taking the best historical
vaccination coverage achieved, or if not available by taking the best historical
coverage across all countries in 2018.
}
\details{
Planned campaigns are the planned campaingns targets provided by WHO technical
programs based on member states planifications.
