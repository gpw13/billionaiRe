<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of billionaiRe is to provide an easy interface for using long format
data to calculate the World Health Organization's Triple Billions.

## Installation

You can install billionaiRe from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```  r
remotes::install_github("gpw13/billionaiRe", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

You will need to have already installed the wppdistro and whdh packages, which is stored in a private repo and only made public upon request from valid WHO users. Please contact messeillere@who.int to request access.

# Calculations

The package is built around a set of functions that calculate the Billions
for the three Billions separately:

* Healthier Populations (HPOP)
* Health Emergencies Protection (HEP)
* Universal Health Coverage (UHC)

## HPOP Billion calculation

```{r child='vignettes/hpop.rmd'}
```

## UHC Billion calculation

```{r child='vignettes/uhc.rmd'}
```

## HEP Billion calculation

```{r child='vignettes/hep.rmd'}
```

## Scenarios

In the Triple Billions and the billionaiRe package context, scenarios are understood as alternative, plausible, description of how the future may develop based on a set of defined assumptions.

Scenarios must:

1.  Be [tidy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html): each row is a unique combination of iso3 country-code, year, indicator, and scenario (if relevant).
2.  Contain **all** and **only** the data that is strictly needed for calculations with billionaiRe

Four main sets of scenarios can be identified, from the most basic to the more complex:

1.  Basic scenarios: Those scenarios are the building blocks of the other scenarios, but they can also be called on their own. They can reach a fixed target at a specified year (`scenario_fixed_target()`), follow a specific rate of change (`scenario_aroc()`), etc. See [Basic scenario](./vignettes/basic-scenarios.html) for more details.
2.  Target scenarios: Target-based scenarios apply indicator-specific targets or trajectories to be reached by a specific date (e.g. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets (called `sdg` scenarios)).
3.  Benchmarking scenarios: Benchmarking scenarios compare performance of countries given various grouping and aim at a specified sub-set of best performing countries.
4.  Mixed scenarios: Developped with indicator-level subject matter knowledge to pick realistic improvement scenarios (e.g. `acceleration` scenarios)

If billionaiRe require data that is missing in the scenario, they will be recycled from other scenarios (see [Data recycling](./vignettes/data-recycling.html)).

See [Scenarios vignette](./vignettes/basic-scenarios.html) for more details.

### Quick start on billionaiRe scenarios

`add_scenario()` is the entry point function to all other scenario functions. It essentially allow to pass a typical billionaiRe data frame (`df`) and apply the selected scenario function.

```{r scenario-example-setup, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(billionaiRe)

df <- tibble::tibble(
    value = 60:80,
    year = 2010:2030,
    ind = "pm25",
    type = "reported",
    iso3 = "AFG",
    scenario = "default",
    source = NA_character_
  ) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(scenario = dplyr::case_when(
      year > 2021 ~ "historical",
      TRUE ~ scenario
    ),
    type = dplyr::case_when(
      year > 2021 ~ "projected",
      TRUE ~ type
    ))
```

The choice of scenario function to apply to the `df` is done through the `scenario_function` parameter. Additional parameters can be passed through the ellipsis (`...`).

For instance, to halt the rise to the 2010 value by `end_year` (2025 by default), we can apply a simple function to `df`. This will apply the `halt_rise` function to all unique combination of country and indicator. In this case, there is just one combination:

```{r scenario-example-single-function, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
df %>%
  add_scenario(
    scenario_function = "halt_rise",
    baseline_year = 2010
  )
```

To apply the SDG targets, we use the `sdg`:

```{r scenario-example-sdg-start-2018, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
df %>%
  add_scenario(
    scenario_function = "sdg"
  )
```

By default, the scenarios start from the last reported or estimated value in the default scenario. This can be bypassed by setting `start_scenario_last_default` to FALSE. The scenario will then start at `start_year` (2018 by default):

```{r scenario-example-sdg-start-last, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
df %>%
  add_scenario(
    scenario_function = "sdg",
    start_scenario_last_default = FALSE
  )
```
